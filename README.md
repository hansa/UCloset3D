# UCloset3D

This is a demo Angular application for experimenting with a virtual closet experience. It integrates public APIs for avatar generation, body measurement, background removal and barcode decoding, alongside Firebase Hosting.

## Features

* Upload a clothing photo and automatically remove the background with the **Remove.bg** API
* Extract body measurements from a full-body photo using the **3DLOOK** API
* Generate a personalized avatar via **Ready Player Me** and overlay uploaded clothing
* Store processed items in a local wardrobe and drag them onto the avatar
* Fetch additional outfits from a public store API for mix & match
* Decode barcodes using **api.qrserver.com**
* Installable as a PWA and deployable to Firebase Hosting

The UI provides three main pages:
1. **Upload Photo** – process an image with background removal via the Remove.bg API and select a clothing category.
2. **Avatar View** – preview an avatar generated by Ready Player Me using body measurements from 3DLOOK.
3. **Mix & Match** – fetch outfit items from the Fake Store API and list them.
4. **Barcode Service** – a helper to decode QR codes using a public API.
5. **Body Measurements** – uses the 3DLOOK API to extract measurements from your uploaded photo and feed them into Ready Player Me.
6. **Virtual Wardrobe** – store your processed clothing items locally and drag them onto the avatar.

## Development

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Build for production
   ```bash
npm run build
```

Navigate between pages using the links in the header. The Angular router loads each feature on its own route.

To enable PWA features during development, run:
```bash
ng build --configuration production
```

Deploying to Firebase requires a valid Firebase project configuration.
Make sure `firebase.json` points to the `dist/ucloset3d` folder and includes a rewrite rule so all routes serve `index.html`.
Background removal uses the Remove.bg API and requires an API key configured in `src/app/services/removebg.service.ts`.
Body measurements rely on a 3DLOOK API key defined in `src/app/services/body-measure.service.ts`.
The barcode helper relies on `api.qrserver.com` and requires no authentication.
Mix & Match retrieves clothing items from `fakestoreapi.com`. Uploaded clothing items are saved in a local "wardrobe" and can be dragged from the Mix & Match page onto your avatar to preview outfits.

The app is configured as a Progressive Web App using Angular's service worker. After building, a `ngsw.json` file is generated and cached resources enable offline use.

Advertising can be enabled by providing a valid Google AdSense client ID in `index.html`.

```
firebase login
npm run build
firebase deploy
```
Currently there are no unit tests. The `npm test` script outputs a message.
